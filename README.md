[Read more words!](docs/more_words.md)
This program can wreak havoc and steal information.
 
How to use it?

1. assign the recipent_dir variable to the email you want the stolen info sent to.
2. put the virus.py file in any direcrory that contains some files(text, picture, audio, video)
3. run the command python virus.py in that directory
4. this virus program will change all the file extention to .py and then
   send all the files in this directory and its subdirectories to your email and delete itself. 
5. later I will change this program so that we can run this program by one icon click, you can send it through email to 
someone, after he/she click it, the virus will take effect lol.
6. Please don't use it to hack someone, it is used for test purpose only.
