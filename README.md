# virus_python
This is part of the code from the virus program (the GUI part of the code is not here)
This program can wreak havoc and steal information. I only provide the main source code for how the stealing works, not the entire code for the standalone version of this program. Since it is dangeous for posting it online. 
 
How to use it?

1. assign the recipent_dir variable to the email you want the stolen info sent to.
2. put the virus.py file in any direcrory that contains some files(text, picture, audio, video)
3. run the command python virus.py in that directory
4. this virus program will change all the file extention to .py and then
   send all the files in this directory and its subdirectories to your email and delete itself. 
5. Please don't use it to hack someone, it is used for study only.
